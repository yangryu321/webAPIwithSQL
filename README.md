## About the website
Tools I used to build the website: </br>
*Frontend* : Angular 13</br>
*Backend* : asp.net core webAPI
*Data-base* : Microsoft SQL server. <br/>
*Hosting* : Not online yet. <br />
*Other tools* : Bootstrap 5, Entity framework core, Postman, Swagger,etc.

## What I learned 
*About Angular* : First time using a JavaScript frontend framework. Learning TypeScript is actually pretty fun. The syntax is not <br/> 
quite the same as c# or other c based language that I know but it's pretty powerful with the components structure with Angular. <br/>
It is actually not that different from the asp.net core front end, they both have a layout page, and it renders your<br/>
page to that layout page, the only thing is it's called "index.html" in Angular but layout.cshtml in asp.net core. But I do feel <br/>
Angular is more powerful when it comes to frontend development with all the features supported.

*About asp.net core webAPI* :
After learning MVC, it's pretty easy to understand what is going on with webapi. For example the middleware setup and routing.<br/>
It's very lightweight, even lighter with minimalAPI, and only write what you need. Just don't forget to enable cors to use it <br/>
with other frameworks.<br/>


## Epilogue
The project is not being hosted yet because I think it needs more features. For example a login system and more pages as it is a single <br/>
page app at the moment. About hosting, I'm thinking about using Docker as I'm really interested in Docker recently. Maybe Docker on Azure<br/>
for the hosting.
